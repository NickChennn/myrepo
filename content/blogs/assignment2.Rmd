## 1. Summary and preview of the dataset

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
skim(movies)
glimpse(movies)

```


## 2. Calculation and Visualization of Confidence Interval

```{r, fig.height=4, out.width="100%"}

# Filtering data for directors
movies<-movies%>%
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

#director=="Steven Spielberg",mean=7.57 ,the 95% confidence interval is [7.27,7.87]
a<-movies%>%
  filter(director=="Steven Spielberg")
t.test(a$rating)

#director=="Tim Burton",mean=6.93 ,the 95% confidence interval is [6.53,7.33]
b<-movies%>%
  filter(director=="Tim Burton")
t.test(b$rating)


df <- tibble(
  director = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"),
  mean = c(7.57, 6.93),
  lower = c( 7.27,6.53),
  upper = c( 7.87, 7.33)
) %>% 
  map_df(rev)


options(ggplot2.discrete.colour= c("#F8766D", "#00BFC4"))

p <- ggplot(data = df,aes(color = director))
p+geom_errorbarh(aes(y=forcats::fct_inorder(director),xmin=lower,xmax=upper),
                 height=0.1,
                 size=1.5)+
  #geom_text(aes(label=VAL),size=4,Vjust=-0.5)+
  geom_text(aes(label = mean, x = mean, y = director), vjust = -1.5, size=6, color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = lower, x = lower, y = director), vjust = -2.5, size=4, color = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(label = upper, x = upper, y = director), vjust = -2.5, size=4, color = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(x=mean,y=director),size=5)+
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings",
          subtitle = "95% confidence intercals overlap")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  xlab("Mean IMBD Rating")+
  ylab("")+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=7.271, xmax=7.311, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf), color = NA,alpha = .1)

```

## 3. Hypothesis Testing using the t-test and "infer" package

Null hypotheses:the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same .\
Alternative hypotheses:the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are not the same .\

Using the t-test:

```{r}

t.test(rating ~ director, data = movies)

```

Using the infer package:\

```{r, hypothesis_testing_with_infer_package}

# Calculate diff in means

obs_diff <- movies %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"))


# Infer package

null_dist <- movies %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton"))

# Plot the relevant values

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")+
  theme_bw()

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```

**Answer:**\

Both the formula as well as the infer approach showed (p-value \< 5% etc.) that we can reject the null hypothesis. At the end of the day we thus conclude that indeed the true difference in means between Steven Spielberg Movies and Tim Burton Movies is not equal to 0.
